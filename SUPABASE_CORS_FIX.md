# Supabase Data Loading Issue in Production

## Problem Description

The application works fine in local development but fails to display data in tables when deployed to production, except for the Itineraries page.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating, we identified several issues:

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Supabase's Row Level Security policies are properly enforced in production but were likely bypassed in development.

2. **Authentication Inconsistency**: The Itineraries page works because it uses React Query with proper error handling, while other pages make direct Supabase queries.

3. **CORS Configuration**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing issues when making requests from the production domain to Supabase.

4. **Headers Handling**: In production, some required headers may not be properly set when making requests to Supabase.

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented several fixes to address these issues:

### 1. Enhanced Supabase Client

The Supabase client has been updated to:
- Properly handle CORS in production
- Include necessary authentication headers
- Add comprehensive error logging
- Attempt anonymous login in development mode to mimic production behavior

### 2. Diagnostic Tools

- Added a `/debug` page accessible at `https://yourdomain.com/debug` to test table access
- Created a `supabase-check.html` page to verify Supabase connectivity
- Added detailed logging to help diagnose issues

### 3. Build Process Improvements

- Created a `build:prod` script that includes a CORS fix
- Added a script to inject CORS handling into the built index.html
- Enhanced error handling throughout the application

## How to Build for Production

Always use the enhanced build script for production:

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

This will:
1. Build the application
2. Apply CORS fixes
3. Generate diagnostic tools

## Supabase Configuration Requirements

For the application to work properly in production, you need to configure Supabase correctly:

1. **CORS Settings**:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard > Project Settings > API
   - Add your production domain to the allowed origins list
   - Include both `https://yourdomain.com` and `https://www.yourdomain.com` if applicable
   - Don't include trailing slashes

2. **Row Level Security**:
   - Ensure proper RLS policies are in place
   - For public data, set policies that allow access to anonymous users
   - For authenticated-only data, ensure policies check for authenticated users

3. **Authentication**:
   - If tables require authentication, make sure users are properly logged in
   - Check session persistence in localStorage

## Testing After Deployment

After deploying, visit these URLs to verify the fix:

1. `/supabase-check.html` - Verifies direct Supabase connectivity
2. `/debug` - Tests access to individual tables
3. Check browser console for detailed logs
